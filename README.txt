= Test::Unit (Classic)

* http://rubyforge.org/projects/test-unit/

== DESCRIPTION:

Test::Unit (Classic) - Nathaniel Talbott's originial test-unit,
externalized from the ruby project as a gem (for tool developers).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Test::Unit 1.2.3 is the original Test::Unit, taken
  straight from the ruby distribution. It is being
  distributed as a gem to allow tool builders to use it as a
  stand-alone package. (The test framework in ruby is going
  to radically change very soon).

* DO NOT INSTALL THIS GEM unless you're active state or some other
  development tool provider! You don't need it.

* Test::Unit 2.0.0 or later are extended versions of the
  original Test::Unit (== Tset::Unit 1.2.3).

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install test-unit
